# Hello, I'm Klaudja! 👋
## About Me
 


- 💻 I'm a passionate junior Python developer , 27 years young based in Germany.
- 🎓 Bachelor's in Technology and Information
- 🌱 I'm on a journey of continuous learning, exploring the vast possibilities that Python offers
- 👨‍💻 On the lookout for internship opportunities
- 💬 Let's chat about anything Python or development-related
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll find me balancing between two equally enriching activities. I find solace in the pages of a good book. At the same time, I embrace the tranquility of yoga, 
     fostering mindfulness and flexibility. It's a harmonious blend of literature and yoga that keeps both my mind and body in balance.
