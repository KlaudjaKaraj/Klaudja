# Hello, I'm Klaudja! 👋
## About Me
I'm a passionate junior Python developer , 27 years young based in Germany. 
I'm on a journey of continuous learning, exploring the vast possibilities that Python offers.

- 🌱 Currently honing my skills in Django Framework
- 💬 Let's chat about anything Python or development-related!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to dive into different literary worlds, and my ideal weekend includes getting lost in a good book.
